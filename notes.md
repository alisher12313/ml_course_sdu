# 📘 Notes on CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics)

## 1. What is CFD?
- CFD = Computational Fluid Dynamics
- Science of predicting fluid flow, heat and mass transfer, chemical reactions, and related phenomena
- To predict these phenomena, CFD solves equations for conservation of mass, Newton's second law, conservation of energy and etc.
- CFD can provide detailed information on the fluid behavior:
    - Distribution of pressure, velocity, temperature etc.
    - Forces like lift, drag and etc. (external flows, Aero auto...)
    - Distribution of multiple phases (gas-liquid, gas-solid...)
    - Species composition (reactions, combustion, pollutants...)
    - and other many stuff.
- CFD is used in all stages of the engineering process:
    - Conceptual studies of new designs
    - Detailed product development
    - Optimization
    - Troubleshooting
    - Redesign
- CFD analysis complements testing and experimentation by reducing total effort and cost required for experimentation and data acquisition

## 2. How CFD works
- Domain is discretized into finite set of control volumes
- General transport equations are solved on this set of contol volumes
